Automate Revive Testnet Faucet Claim

## Overview

ReviveTestnet is a Python script designed to automate the process of claiming tokens from the Revive Testnet Faucet. This tool simplifies obtaining test tokens for development and testing on the Revive blockchain testnet by programmatically submitting faucet requests.

## Features

- Automatically send faucet requests to the Revive Testnet Faucet
- Simple Python implementation using HTTP requests
- Easy to configure with your wallet address
- Helps streamline testnet token acquisition for developers

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- Internet connection to access the Revive Testnet Faucet endpoint

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Caldegorn/ReviveTestnet.git
cd ReviveTestnet
```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
```

3. Install required packages (if any):

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

*(If `requirements.txt` is not present, the script likely uses only standard libraries like `requests`.)*

## Usage

1. Open `rv.py` and update the `wallet_address` variable with your Revive Testnet wallet address.

2. Run the script:

```
python rv.py
```

3. The script will send a request to the faucet and output the response, indicating whether the claim was successful.

## Example Output

```
Requesting tokens for wallet: YourWalletAddressHere
Faucet response: {'status': 'success', 'message': 'Tokens sent successfully'}
```

## Notes

- Faucet requests may be rate-limited; avoid sending requests too frequently.
- Ensure your wallet address is correct to receive the test tokens.
- This script is intended for testnet use only.
